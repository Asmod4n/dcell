DCell is a simple and easy way to build distributed applications in Ruby.
Somewhat similar to DRb, DCell lets you easily expose Ruby objects as network
services, and call them remotely just like you would any other Ruby object.
However, unlike DRb all objects in the system are concurrent. You can create
and register several available services on a given node, obtain handles to
them, and easily pass these handles around the network just like any other
objects.

DCell is a distributed extension to [Celluloid][celluloid], which provides
concurrent objects for Ruby with many of the features of Erlang, such as the
ability to supervise objects and restart them when they crash, and also link to
other objects and receive event notifications of when they crash. This makes
it easier to build robust, fault-tolerant distributed systems.

DCell uses the [0MQ][zeromq] messaging protocol which provides a robust,
fault-tolerant brokerless transport for asynchronous messages sent between
nodes. DCell is built on top of the [Celluloid::ZMQ][celluloid-zmq] library,
which provides a Celluloid-oriented wrapper around the underlying
[ffi-rzmq][ffi-rzmq] library.

### Is It Good?

Yes.

### Is It "Production Readyâ„¢"?

Not entirely, but eager early adopters are welcome!

Supported Platforms
-------------------

DCell works on Ruby 1.9.3, JRuby 1.6, and Rubinius 2.0.

DCell requires Ruby 1.9 mode on all interpreters. This works out of the
box on MRI/YARV, and requires the following flags elsewhere:

* JRuby: --1.9 command line option, or JRUBY_OPTS=--1.9 environment variable
* rbx: -X19 command line option
