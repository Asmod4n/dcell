Ideally DCell would use Celluloid::IO to monitor 0MQ sockets. Unfortunately,
ffi-rzmq presently does not present an API for obtaining an IO object from a
0MQ socket.

This directory contains a temporary workaround Celluloid::ZMQ which uses
a ZMQ::Poller to monitor for 0MQ activity. This implementation is hardly
anywhere near ideal but it works and provides a temporary solution until
ffi-rzmq implements an API for retrieving IO objects.
